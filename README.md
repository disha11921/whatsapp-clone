Objective:
The aim of this project is to create a simple front-end mockup of a WhatsApp-like chat interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This mockup provides a foundational understanding of web development concepts, particularly in building interactive chat applications.

Key Features:

User Interface:
A visually appealing design that mimics the WhatsApp application.
A sidebar displaying a list of contacts, including "My Love," "Sis," and "Mum."
A dedicated chat area that shows messages exchanged between the user and the selected contact.
Messaging Functionality:
The ability to send messages, which are displayed in the chat area.
Messages are visually distinguished between sent and received, enhancing user experience and clarity.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the web page and defining the layout.
CSS: For styling the interface, ensuring it is user-friendly and responsive.
JavaScript: To handle user interactions, such as sending messages and dynamically updating the chat display.
Sample Conversation:
The chat interface includes a sample conversation with "My Love," showcasing typical messages exchanged, such as greetings and inquiries about travel.
Potential for Expansion:
The project can be extended to include features like user authentication, real-time messaging (using WebSocket), and integration with a backend server for message storage.
Consideration for using modern frameworks like React or Vue.js for a more dynamic and scalable application.
